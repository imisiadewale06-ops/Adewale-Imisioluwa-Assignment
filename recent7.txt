5 differences between stacks and queues
1. Order of element removal
   * Stack: Last In, First Out (LIFO)
   * Queue: First In, First Out (FIFO)

2. Operations

   * Stack: push (add), pop (remove)
   * Queue: enqueue (add), dequeue (remove)

3. Access point

   * Stack: Elements are added and removed from the same end (top).
   * Queue: Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

4. Use cases

   * Stack: Undo mechanisms, function call stack, backtracking.
   * Queue: Task scheduling, buffers, print queues.

5. Processing order

   * Stack: Processes the most recently added item first.
   * Queue: Processes the earliest added item first.
 
2. find out time complexity of stack and queues
Stack Time Complexity

* Push (insert): O(1)
* Pop (remove): O(1)
* Peek (top element): O(1)
* Search: O(n)

Queue Time Complexity
* Enqueue (insert): O(1)
* Dequeue (remove): O(1)
* Front/Peek: O(1)
* Search: O(n)
