State the time and space complexity of the last 2 questions (both 5&6)
1. Linear Search
Array: [2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20]
Target: 10

Time Complexity:
Worst case: O(n) → if the target is at the last position or not in the array.
Best case: O(1) → if the target is at the first position.
Average case: O(n/2) → simplified as O(n).

Space Complexity:
O(1) → only a few variables (i, maybe index) are used; no extra array is created.

2. Binary Search
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
Target: 9

Time Complexity:
Binary search divides the search space by 2 each time.
Worst case: O(log n) → n elements halved until one element is left.
Best case: O(1) → if the target is at mid in the first iteration.

Space Complexity:
Iterative implementation: O(1) → only variables low, high, mid are used.
Recursive implementation: O(log n) → due to recursion stack.
